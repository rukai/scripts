# mv_renum [-n] [-#] filenames...
# mv_reseq [-nr] [-#|-#.#] filenames...
#
# Quick renumbering of the the LAST number in the filenames appropriately
# ordering the sequence of renaming to ensure no file is overwritten during the
# process.  Files are only renamed if needed.
#
# mv_renum
#
# Set the last number in each filename to a fixed width (2 by default, or the
# width given in the -# option).  This is done by adding and removing leading
# "0"s to fit the width.  A width of 1 (option -1) will just strip all leading
# "0"s.
#
# For any other width the program will abort before doing anything if a number
# is found that will NOT fit the width.
#
# mv_reseq
#
# Re-sequence the last number in each file into accending order. The numerical
# order of the files (not the alphabetical order) is preserved! By default the
# numbered sequence starts at 1, and increments by 1.
#    -#    Change the start number, and increment by 1
#    -.#   Set both start and increment to the same number given
#    -#.#  Set start and increment numbers individually
# The width of the number in the filenames are always resized to the maximum
# width found in all filenames, or the width which can contain the largest
# number.
#
# The -r option will reverse the ordering of the files (inverse reseq)
#
# Even if processing begins however, the program will NEVER overwrite an
# existing file.
#
# See Also
#   mv_perl    Renames filenames based on a perl RE (or code)
#   rename     Renames by replacing one string with another (Gnu-Linux)
#   mved       Renames both sides of the variable part.
